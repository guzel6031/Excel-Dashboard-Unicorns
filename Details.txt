In this project there is two file that is, one csv file that contains raw data and another one is 
excel file that contains 'Dashboard', 'Calculated Data' and 'Raw Data' sheets respectively.

I have created a dashboard which shows three type of visuals.

First Visual- It's a scrolling table with a scrolling bar that shows top Fourty Unicorns along with there company name,
industry,country,valuations,Date of joining.
It is calculated using index function.

Second Visual- It's column bar chart that shows Top Five and Bottom Five company, which is controlled by Form Control Developer Tool.
It is calculated using choose function, large function and small function.

Third Visual- It is a line chart, basically a type of time series line chart which is controlled by drop down list.
It is calculated using index and match function.
